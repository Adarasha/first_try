Learning git &amp; github for the 1st time :
<br>
first I install git on my UBANTU LiNUX , make id on github, id and user name on git, opean folder in code editor (vs code)<br>
i am using/ taking help from yt vdo of aafna colz https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ez8F0nW6S-w&t=1s 
<br> now i aam in vs code typing this line and trying to push it on git hub ...
<br> Also before pussing i also wanna make a try.html file [which should be untracted file]...
<br> than i add try.html [git add try.html] 
<br> Which showed README.md modified as before and try.html new file...
<br> now since try.html is stagged [with add commamd],let me try to commit [cpmmit commamd]
<br> But first Let me Add README.md [with (git add .),which will add all changes.]
<br>now it shows modified to README.md and new file to try.html..<br>
now Let me 1st commit this,whih git commit -m "" <br>
2 file changed now, 6 insertions(+) [I wonder wot that mean], 1 deletion(-)[hope it mean something good]<br>
Now it is saved in git, let me try to push it on git hub,[I thought add and commit will push my file in git hub but i was wrong, it just save my progess in project on git on my local devie.]<br>
Now i am writing to push code in git hub [git puch origin main] <br>
